### What I learned

I'm most proud of how I integrated accessibility into the hamburger menu and achieved a responsive design across various components. Using Sass and CUBE CSS for styling allowed me to create a modular and maintainable codebase, especially as I built responsive grids in both the about and products sections. Next time, Iâ€™d like to experiment with a CSS framework like Tailwind to streamline some of the utility classes and explore more efficient ways to achieve responsive layouts.

One of the primary challenges was designing an accessible hamburger menu that worked smoothly across devices. I focused on making it accessible by implementing keyboard navigation and ensuring screen readers could interact with it easily. The responsive grid layout for the products section was also challenging, particularly in making it adapt well between mobile and desktop. For this, I utilized CSS Grid and media queries in combination to ensure it displayed optimally on different screen sizes.

### Useful resources
